# Coffee Sales Excel Project

## Problem Statement
A Coffee Business has accumulated extensive data from 2019 to 2022 on its operations, comprising detailed records of orders, customer demographics, and product information. However, this wealth of data remains underutilized. The company lacks a clear understanding of its sales patterns, customer preferences, and product performance. Without this insight, the business struggles to make informed decisions to drive growth, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize its product offerings.

## Objective
To analyze the business's data, encompassing orders, customers, and products tables, in order to:
- Identify sales trends and patterns across different time periods.
- Understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Evaluate product performance and profitability of each roast type and coffee type.
- Provide actionable insights for improving sales strategies, customer engagement, and product offerings.
- This analysis aims to leverage data-driven insights to support the Coffee Business in making strategic decisions that enhance overall business performance and customer satisfaction.
